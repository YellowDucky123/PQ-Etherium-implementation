# PQ-Etherium-implementation

This is a Proof of implementation of a PQ signature scheme in C++ that works relatively well with an arbitrary PQ-SNARK. 
This Proof of Implementation is based on the 
"Hash-Based Multi-Signatures for Post-Quantum Ethereum" paper written by Justin Drake, Ethereum Foundation
Dmitry Khovratovich, Ethereum Foundation
Mikhail Kudinov, Eindhoven University of Technology
